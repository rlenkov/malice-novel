Today is the day when I see someone being murdered for the first time.
It happens early in the morning, on the waking streets of Sandorgrad. I am on tram number forty-seven, as always at this hour, rattling to downtown. Having no seats left I've got to stand. From the leaden sky, a thick autumn fog descends, choking the city, banishing all colors but grey and white. I see only look-alike building blocks passing by through the dusty windows. There is no heating in the ancient carriage. My nails turn purple in the rigorous cold, as I hold the handrail. Even my breath is visible. Enveloped by eerie lights of the foggy morning, my companions seem insentient, as if they were only snoring, coughing husks. I have been using this tram for fifteen years, and I see the same faces every morning. I have known some of them since childhood.

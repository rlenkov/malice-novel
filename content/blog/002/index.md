My fingers go white as I’m grasping the rusty iron lavatory with trembling legs. To my right the wooden door shakes hard, as someone starts banging on the other side, with such a force that it almost breaks from its rusty hinges.
“Valerija! You are late seventy minutes! Se-ven-ty! We might not have visitors today, but that inventory list will not write itself! ”
I wash my mouth, and slowly rise my head so I can see myself in the murky mirror. I remind myself to a corpse fresh from the riverbank. My green eyes are red and puffy, and I even smeared my eyeliner pretty bad as I teared up. Having a bony face and thin features does not improve the picture either.
This was the third time I’ve thrown up today, but still my stomach turns when I think back to what happened at the Alexander plaza station. An agonizing tram ride, and an hour long police interview later I’m here at the Uni, making mess in the toilet. Not like the assistants quarters - or as we call it, the slave pens - could get any messier . Next to me old plaster had come away from the walls, revealing black mould, and the lavatory is thick with years old limescale.

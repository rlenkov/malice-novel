My fingers go white as I’m grasping the rusty iron lavatory with trembling legs. To my right the wooden door shakes hard, as someone starts banging on the other side, with such a force that it almost breaks from its rusty hinges.
“Valerija! You are late seventy minutes! Se-ven-ty! We might not have visitors today, but that inventory list will not write itself! ”
I wash my mouth, and slowly rise my head so I can see myself in the murky mirror. I remind myself to a corpse fresh from the riverbank. My green eyes are red and puffy, and I even smeared my eyeliner pretty bad as I teared up. Having a bony face and thin features does not improve the picture either.
This was the third time I’ve thrown up today, but still my stomach turns when I think back to what happened at the Alexander plaza station. An agonizing tram ride, and an hour long police interview later I’m here at the Uni, making mess in the toilet. Not like the assistants quarters - or as we call it, the slave pens - could get any messier . Next to me old plaster had come away from the walls, revealing black mould, and the lavatory is thick with years old limescale.
“I do not care what happened this morning, or why the police had to question you for, but I do not tolerate disturbances. If you’re trouble, you can go find a another place to be late from. 5 minutes in the record office.”
With a sigh I straighten up and grab a comb to get my messed up ebony hair into an organized ponytail. I check my uniform to make sure it’s not stained. It's a black long dress with a laced corset top. I can hardly imagine a uniform more uncomfortable and impractical - but that’s what ‘pleases the eyes of the professors’ so we’re told. But hey, here’s the benefit for being a flat chest - at least I can breathe in this. Lastly, I fix my eyes, and I put on the mandatory red lipstick. There, Now I look like a dominatrix with a librarian kink, ready to get to work.
I leave the dressing room and start striding down the corridor connecting our quarters to the main reception. I stumble a few times on the way, till I get used to my high heels after the sneakers. As I get through half of the way I slowly give up hope, put my feelings in my pocket, and set my mind blank until my shift is done. That’s my way of coping with this soul eating job. Plus I bitch about quotas occasionally in lunch break, but that’s pretty standard.
At the end of the corridor, turning a brass door handle I get to the main reception, a gorgeous hall with mosaic marble floors, limestone pillars and colored frescos as high as eyes can see. It’s similar to how temples looked like in the ancient times.
I want to continue my stride, but suddenly a sound makes me linger on the threshold. It like a distant echo coming from behind me. A sound of water dripping. Is it a busted water pipe somewhere?
“Valerija! - There she is, our Financial Clerk. Valerija come here!”
